abstract = "Objectives: The previous studies have reported that adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) can have detrimental effects on victims’ attachment styles, emotion regulation strategies and depression. How the insecure attachment styles and emotion dysregulation strategies play a role in the relationship between ACEs and depression among Chinese university students remains unclear. Methods: The research was made known to students studying at universities in China. Five hundred and eighty-nine college students completed questionnaires measuring ACEs, insecure attachment styles, emotion dysregulation strategies and depression. Sequential chain mediation model was built by Mplus. Results: The model showed that insecure attachment styles and emotion dysregulation strategies mediated the relationship between ACEs and depression respectively. Moreover, the sequential chain mediation showed an indirect path (ACEs - insecure attachment styles - emotion dysregulation strategies - depression). Conclusion: Following childhood adversities, students can experience elevated depression which is influenced by attachment styles and emotion regulation strategies."

abstract = "Trait social anxiety may predict differences in the cognitive control of emotional distraction when emotional face discrimination is required. This effect can be investigated using an emotional face flanker task. This study addresses an important research gap, as previous studies did not separate the effects of trait social interaction anxiety from the effects of trait social phobia upon emotional face flanker task performance. In this laboratory based behavioural experiment, the 87 participants (mean age 24.3) were university students or staff recruited via departmental adverts. We used an emotional (happy versus fearful) face flanker task, and assessed sub-clinical social anxiety with the SIAS/SPS. Elevated trait social phobia was related to an increased reaction time (RT) congruency effect, whereas trait social interaction anxiety was not. Elevated trait social interaction anxiety was related to a decreased happy face RT advantage for central target faces, but the effect of trait social phobia was very weak. Trait social interaction anxiety and trait social phobia may predict subtle differences when the cognitive control of reactions to emotional facial expressions is required."

abstract = "Emotion regulation strategies such as rumination and suppression have been consistently associated with distress and psychopathology. However, it is not yet known why people engage in maladaptive strategies instead of adaptive strategies despite their negative consequences. Beliefs about emotion have been theorized to influence which emotion regulation strategies are used, and therefore, the development of emotional disorders. This research seeks to test these predictions. We present a cross-sectional study (N = 400) using confirmatory factor analysis, as well as mediation analysis within a structural equation modeling framework. Beliefs that emotions are undesirable and uncontrollable emerged as interrelated yet separate factors. Both types of beliefs were associated with emotional distress (r = .36 for emotion undesirability, r = .53 for emotion uncontrollability), and more use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (r = .32; r = .44; respectively). SEM analyses showed that maladaptive emotion regulation strategies mediated the link between undesirability and uncontrollability beliefs and emotional distress. These results provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that negative beliefs about emotions influence the use of generally maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, intensifying symptomatology."

abstract = "Humans need to accurately infer the intentions and feelings of others to engage in successful social interaction. However, the application of artificial intelligence technology in Education (AIEd) forms a human–machine collaborative environment which changed the interaction relationship of individuals, it may have an affect on them. This study aimed to explore whether AIEd affects adolescents’ emotional perception. Combined with the actual teaching situation and the result of the questionnaire, 1332 students recruited through random sampling from AI Curriculum Reform Demonstration Schools in Guangzhou participated in this study. Different emotional priming stimulative materials (sentences and situational pictures) were used in the experiments. The task was designed to investigate adolescents’ reaction time to emotional faces (positive, negative). After eliminating blank data and invalid data with response time greater than 150 ms, 977 and 962 valid data were included in the statistical analysis in experiment 1 and experiment 2 respectively. Results show that AIEd has a negative effect on adolescents’ emotional perception. Prior research has focused on theory to the exclusion of practical applications and the psychological impact of AIEd, thus this study makes an innovative contribution in exploring the impact of the application of artificial intelligence technology in education on adolescents’ physical and mental development by using empirical research methods."

Experiment 1 designed the Group Preemptive Strike Game and found that in intergroup situations, individuals experienced intense fear and hope when they faced the potential threat from gaming counterparts, but their preemptive behaviors were not altered. Experiments 2 and 3 were designed to simulate real-life groups with characteristics such as punishment (Experiment 2) and leadership (Experiment 3), and found that people experienced fear and hope when they faced the potential threat and tended to attack preemptively. Fear and hope were mediators between the potential threats and preemptive behaviors, in which fear increased the preemptive behaviors and hope decreased the preemptive behaviors. This study improves the security and well–being of people by helping them find solutions to defensive aggression."

abstract = "Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have difficulty with emotion regulation relative to their non-ADHD peers, including the use of distraction and reappraisal to regulate emotions. The aim of the current study was to examine emotion regulation in children and adolescents with ADHD using distraction and reappraisal strategies. A group of 20 children and adolescents with ADHD (85% male; mean age = 11.55) and 20 non-ADHD matched controls (85% male; mean age = 11.65 years) completed an experimental task in which they were instructed to react naturally or decrease negative emotion using distraction and reappraisal in response to negative emotional pictures. Participants were asked to rate their emotion after viewing each picture. A significant main effect of instruction on emotion regulation was found, indicating that the distraction and reappraisal instructions improved emotion regulation in both groups. No effect for group or group by instruction was significant. Children and adolescents with ADHD can regulate their emotions as well as non-ADHD controls when they are trained to use distraction and reappraisal. Treatment development efforts should consider the addition of training in emotion regulation strategies for children and adolescents with ADHD."

The female participants exhibited markedly lower success in detecting Narcissism, particularly for male faces, and better success in detecting both Machiavellianism and Psychopathy. For the male participants, one notes the relatively lower success at detecting Psychopathy for female faces, and the relatively lower success at detecting Narcissism for male faces."

abstract = "Judging truthfulness and detecting deception are critical in the criminal justice system as well as in many other applied contexts (e.g., clinical and business organizations). The ability to discriminate a truth-teller from a liar might be associated with the content of deception (e.g., emotional or high-stakes lies) or with the deceiver's characteristics, such as his/her level of confidence shown in lying. The two present studies aimed to manipulate the level of the sender's confidence and to investigate its effect in deception vs. truthfulness judgments of written narratives varying in emotional content. A pilot sample (N = 124) assessed the stimuli validity of sixteen written narratives (Study 1): 8 deceptive vs. truthful narratives x four types of content (i.e., motional/bereavement vs. emotional/car accident vs. emotional/quarrel vs neutral/holiday) with low confidence in the recall and 8 deceptive vs. truthful narratives x four types of content (i.e., emotional/bereavement vs. emotional/car accident vs. emotional/quarrel vs neutral/holiday) high in the confidence recall. An experimental sample (N = 428) was administered the two sequences of eight written narratives and for each narrative, veracity judgment, detection accuracy, and judgment confidence were assessed (Study 2). We found that the sender's confidence, the veracity, and the content of the narratives affected receivers' veracity judgments and detection accuracy. High confidence made receivers prone to judge bereavements and holiday narratives as truthful and quarrels narratives as deceptive. In addition, high confidence made judgments more accurate for truthful narratives on holidays compared with others, and for deceptive narratives on car accidents and quarrels than for other narratives. The present results are discussed in light of their practical implications for the legal field."

abstract = "Expression suppression, a common emotion regulation strategy, involves continuous efforts of the individual to suppress the behavioral expression of their emotional responses. Previous studies on the effect of expression suppression on emotion regulation have reported inconsistent findings. Based on neurophysiological research, the role of expression suppression should be revisited. Therefore, we investigated electroencephalogram (EEG) changes in individuals unconsciously initiating expression suppression while passively observing emotional pictures. We then compared these EEG data with those obtained from individuals engaging in unconscious cognitive reappraisal. Using subjective reporting of emotional experience and event-related potentials (ERPs), i.e., the P1 and late positive potential (LPP), in EEG data, we compared the effects of different emotion regulation strategies on the unconscious emotional responses of 28 college students. Regarding the subjective emotional experience, the reported emotional arousal in the unconscious cognitive reappraisal group and the unconscious expression suppression group was significantly lower than that in the control group, but no significant difference was found between the two groups. The arousal in response to negative pictures was significantly higher than that in response to neutral pictures. Compared with the control group, P1 amplitudes in the parietal and occipital lobes were significantly reduced in the unconscious expression suppression group, and P1 amplitudes in the parietal lobe were significantly decreased in the unconscious expression suppression group. Regarding the LPP amplitude, LPP amplitudes of the unconscious expression suppression group were significantly lower than those of the control group in the three periods, and there was no significant difference with those of the unconscious cognitive reappraisal group in the three periods. The LPP amplitude of the unconscious cognitive reappraisal group was significantly lower than that of the control group at 450–650 ms and 650–800 ms. Therefore, expression suppression occurred slightly earlier than cognitive reappraisal. The P1 latency in the parietal-occipital region of individuals was significantly faster than that in the frontal region. The LPP first manifested in the parietal-occipital region during the 250–800 ms period and expanded to other brain regions over time. The LPP presented differences due to valence at 250–450 ms, but with increased time, the abovementioned differences gradually disappeared. Cognitive reappraisal and expression suppression initiated under unconscious conditions regulated cortical activity in the visual attention and perceptual processing stages. In the early stage of visual attention, unconsciously initiating the two emotion regulation strategies reduced processing of emotional stimuli. In the later stage of perceptual processing, unconsciously initiating the two emotion regulation strategies effectively regulated individuals’ perceptual processing of stimuli."

abstract = "Despite the social nature of emotions, research to date has focused on emotion regulation at the intrapersonal level. Thus, the efficacy of specific emotion regulation strategies within a social dynamic is unclear. This study investigated the relationship between affective convergence and the efficacy of two emotion regulation strategies: reappraisal and suppression. In Study 1, 37 university students in Korea participated in a 2 × 2 laboratory experiment that manipulated emotion regulation strategies and affective convergence (divergence) through a live social interaction with a confederate. The reduction in negative affect was measured to indicate the efficacy of emotion regulation strategies. In Study 2, 248 North American participants completed a 2 × 2 online experiment that included the manipulation of emotion regulation strategies and affective convergence (divergence). To assess each strategy's efficacy, we measured participants' reduction in negative affect and their working memory performance through Stroop task scores. The findings showed that reappraisal was more efficient than suppression when participants received a companion's feedback that was affectively divergent from their own. However, reappraisal was less efficient than suppression in reducing negative affect when participants received a companion's feedback that was affectively convergent with their own. In addition, using reappraisal resulted in better working memory performance in the affective divergence condition but not the affective convergence condition. The findings suggest that the efficacy of emotion regulation strategies depends on interpersonal-level affective constructs, namely, affective convergence (divergence). Future research should revisit the efficacy of emotion regulation strategies under a social dynamic."

abstract = "Previous research has shown that the use of short film clips is one of the most successful and widely-used methods of emotion elicitation. Nevertheless, there is a high degree of audiovisual variation across film clips, resulting in a trade-off in terms of controllability. To address this complexity, the present study aimed to investigate the potential effects of sound and color on film clips’ emotion-elicitation levels. For this purpose, four different film clips were selected for each of the eight emotion categories: amusement, tenderness, calmness, anger, sadness, disgust, fear, and neutrality. All film clips were manipulated in terms of features of sound (sound versus silent) × color (color versus BW). In total, 128 film clips were tested online on various parameters: intensity of target emotion, valence, arousal, discreteness, and non-target emotions. The results revealed that sound was a mild contributing factor in increasing the degree of target emotions and evoking less boredom and more interest. However, color effects were less pronounced in emotion-elicitation using film clips. Furthermore, the study provided preliminary evidence that for most of the film clips, there was no significant difference in emotional reactivity in response to subtitled versus dubbed film clips. In conclusion, the current study showed that film clips (with a few exceptions) can evoke moderate to high levels of emotions independent of their bottom-up features, such as sound or color."
